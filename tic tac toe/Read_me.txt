To use the Tic-Tac-Toe game you will use the number keys 0-8 these represent the spaces you want to select for your move. Specifically, the keys 0-2 are the top row, 3-5 are the middle row, and 6-8 are the bottom row going from left to right respectively. At the end of each turn the program will output the possible moves and which ones will end in what state, i.e. the position (0-8) and which user is most likely to win from that state or if it is likely to end in a draw. Then it will print out the board state after the next best move is selected. Finally, when the game is over it checks to see who won and prints out who it is and will ask the user if he/she wants to play again. To play again type, "yes" all lowercase otherwise type anything else and the game will terminate.
